            <h2>Why Kuala Lumpur?</h2>
            <h3>Kuala Lumpur, home to the famous Petronas Twin Towers</h3>
            <p>
              The city comprises a mixture of modern and traditional
              architecture; such structures as glass-and-concrete skyscrapers,
              elegant mosques, Chinese shop-houses (family-operated shops with
              the business on the ground floor and the family’s living space
              upstairs), squatters’ huts, and Malay stilt kampungs (“villages”)
              betray Western, Middle Eastern, East Asian, and local influences.
              While its centre along the embanked Kelang is heavily congested,
              its municipal area and suburbs are well planned. The commercial
              quarter, called the Golden Triangle, is concentrated on the
              river’s east side. Among its sleek high-rise buildings are three
              of the world’s tallest buildings, the 118-story Merdeka 118 and
              the 88-story Petronas Twin Towers, and one of the tallest
              broadcasting and telecommunications masts, the 1,381-foot
              (421-metre) Kuala Lumpur Tower. Government buildings and the
              notable railway station (all influenced by Moorish design) are on
              the river’s hilly west bank. This nucleus is surrounded by a zone
              of Chinese two-story wooden shop-houses and mixed residential
              areas of Malay kampungs, modern bungalows, and middle-income brick
              flats. The exclusive Bukit Tunku (or Kenny Hills) sector is a
              showcase for upscale dwellings and other structures that blend
              multiple architectural styles.
