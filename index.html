            <h2>Why Kuala Lumpur?</h2>
            <h3>Kuala Lumpur, home to the famous Petronas Twin Towers</h3>
            <p>
              The city comprises a mixture of modern and traditional
              architecture; such structures as glass-and-concrete skyscrapers,
              elegant mosques, Chinese shop-houses (family-operated shops with
              the business on the ground floor and the family’s living space
              upstairs), squatters’ huts, and Malay stilt kampungs (“villages”)
              betray Western, Middle Eastern, East Asian, and local influences.
              While its centre along the embanked Kelang is heavily congested,
              its municipal area and suburbs are well planned. The commercial
              quarter, called the Golden Triangle, is concentrated on the
              river’s east side. Among its sleek high-rise buildings are three
              of the world’s tallest buildings, the 118-story Merdeka 118 and
              the 88-story Petronas Twin Towers, and one of the tallest
              broadcasting and telecommunications masts, the 1,381-foot
              (421-metre) Kuala Lumpur Tower. Government buildings and the
              notable railway station (all influenced by Moorish design) are on
              the river’s hilly west bank. This nucleus is surrounded by a zone
              of Chinese two-story wooden shop-houses and mixed residential
              areas of Malay kampungs, modern bungalows, and middle-income brick
              flats. The exclusive Bukit Tunku (or Kenny Hills) sector is a
              showcase for upscale dwellings and other structures that blend
              multiple architectural styles.

                <h4>Three years old cafe</h4>
                <p>
                  With interstate and international travel still banned for most
                  of us, people have been trying to find places that make them
                  feel like they’ve travelled beyond their day-to-day existence.
                  Three Years Old Café offers this opportunity to café hoppers,
                  especially those looking to reminisce about their time in
                  Melbourne, Australia. Three Years Old Café is a collaboration
                  between three Malaysian friends, who met during their time at
                  university in, you guessed it, Melbourne, and wanted to
                  recreate their own slice of the city’s famous art and coffee
                  scene.

                  Their yuzu cake is the highlight which has a very thick cream
                  layer. Delicious food with relax settings.

                  café, built in the 1927 is situated near the old Pudu Jail.
                  The story goes that our little black house in Jalan Galloway
                  was where most wardens used to stay (hence the name Galloway).

                  Feeka Coffee Roasters is housed in converted town houses in
                  Changkat Bukit Bintang in central KL. This oasis of calm was
                  named for the Swedish word for work, Fika, (spelt the way it
                  is pronounced), which means ‘to take a break’. Once here, you
                  can catch your breath, linger over a book or have quiet
                  conversations. Our range of coffees are brewed from beans
                  sourced from local roasters, striking a balance suited to
                  local tastes. Enjoy a perfect pairing of food and coffee at
                  Feeka for breakfast, lunch, or dinner, and top if off with a
                  selection from our range of house-made mille crepes, pastries,
                  tarts or pies.
